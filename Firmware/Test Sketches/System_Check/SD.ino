/*
  These are low level functions to aid in detecting whether a card is present or not.
  Because of ESP32 v2 core, SdFat can only operate using Shared SPI. This makes the sd->begin test take over 1s
  which causes the RTK product to boot slowly. To circumvent this, we will ping the SD card directly to see if it responds.
  Failures take 2ms, successes take 1ms.

    sdSendCommand      send raw command to SD card, return response

    This routine accepts a single SD command and a 4-byte argument.  It sends
    the command plus argument, adding the appropriate CRC.  It then returns
    the one-byte response from the SD card.

    For advanced commands (those with a command byte having bit 7 set), this
    routine automatically sends the required preface command (CMD55) before
    sending the requested command.

    Upon exit, this routine returns the response byte from the SD card.
    Possible responses are:
      0xff  No response from card; card might actually be missing
      0x01  SD card returned 0x01, which is OK for most commands
      0x??  other responses are command-specific
