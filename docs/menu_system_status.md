*Showing various attributes of the system*

The System Status menu will show a large number of system parameters including a full system check to verify what is and what is not online. For example, if an SD card is detected it will be shown as online. Not all systems have all hardware. For example, the RTK Surveyor does not have an accelerometer so it will always be shown offline.

This menu is helpful when reporting technical issues or requesting support as it displays helpful information about the current ZED-F9x firmware version, and which parts of the unit are online.

Pressing 'r' will allow a user to reset all settings to default including a factory reset of the ZED-F9x receiver. This can be helpful if the unit has been configured into an unknown or problematic state. 

Pressing 'd' will enter a debug menu that is for advanced users.
