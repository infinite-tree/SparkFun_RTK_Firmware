The [SparkFun RTK Surveyor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18443), [SparkFun RTK Express](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18442), [SparkFun RTK Express Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18590), [SparkFun RTK Facet](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19029), and [SparkFun RTK Facet L-Band](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20000) are centimeter-level GNSS receivers. With RTK enabled, these devices can output your location with 14mm horizontal and vertical [*accuracy*](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/accuracy_verification/) at up to 20Hz!

This repo houses the [RTK Product Manual](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/intro/) and the firmware that runs on the SparkFun RTK product line including:

* [SparkFun RTK Facet L-Band](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20000)
* [SparkFun RTK Facet](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19029)

Repository Contents
-------------------

* **/Binaries** - Pre-compiled binaries of SparkFun RTK firmware, suitable for loading (see manual).  Also copies of u-blox firmware and command-line scripts (Windows only) to install them.
* **/Firmware** - Source code for SparkFun RTK firmware as well as various feature unit tests
* **/Graphics** - Original bitmap icons for the display
* **/Uploader_GUI** - A python and Windows executable GUI for updating the firmware on RTK units. See [Updating Firmware From GUI](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/firmware_update/#updating-firmware-from-gui).
* **/u-blox_Update_GUI** - A python and Windows executable GUI for updating the firmware on the u-blox modules within the RTK device (ZED-F9x and NEO-D9S primarily but all u-blox GNSS products are supported). See [Updating u-blox Firmware](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/firmware_update/#zed-f9x-firmware).
* **/docs** - Markdown pages for the [RTK Product Manual](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/intro/)

Repository Branch Structure
---------------------------

This repository has two long-term branches: `main` and `release_candidate`.

With respect to the firmware, `main` is a branch where only changes that are appropriate for all users are applied. Thus, following `main` means updating to normal releases, and perhaps bugfixes to those releases.

In contrast, `release_candidate` is where new code is added as it is developed.

The documentation source code is in docs/ on `main`.  It is built automatically on push and stored in the branch `gh-pages`, from which it is served at the above URL. Documentation changes are pushed directly to main.

Release Process
---------------

A release is made by merging `release_candidate` back to `main`, and then applying a tag to that commit on `main`.

A pre-release is often created using the latest stable release candidate. These binaries will have extra debug statements turned on that will not be present in a formal release, but should not affect behavior of the firmware.

Building from Source
--------------------

For building the firmware, see the [Firmware README](Firmware/readme.md).

For the documention, see [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) and [/workflows/mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml).

For building the Uploader_GUI see the header comments of [RTK_Firkware_Uploader_GUI.py](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/Uploader_GUI/RTK_Firmware_Uploader_GUI.py)

For building the u-blox_Update_GUI see the header comments of [RTK_u-blox_Update_GUI.py](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/blob/main/u-blox_Update_GUI/RTK_u-blox_Update_GUI.py)
